## **Business Activities:**
---

* Cash App has a severe gap between its intended audience compared to where the majority of the United States wealth is held. Cash App has seen record high revenue streams the last 2 years, which have been huge in the growth of the company, though without the older demographics utilizing their platform there could be a concern of longevity in the upcoming years. With the **39%** of users between the ages of 18-29, and it’s measly **9%** of its user base 65 or older it’s easy to see how this could be a problem down the line.

* 18-39 year old adults are the primary consumer base Cash App is intending to bring onto their platform. There are roughly 75 million people within this age group in the U.S. alone, and with over 40 millions users, it’s easy to say they’ve made themselves known to their target audience.

*When it comes to utilizing creativity to set themselves apart from the competition Cash App is doing it right. With their application allowing for international transfers which pairs well with their recent expansion into Europe, it’s easy to say their growth will only persist. Along with that, Cash App recently gave its users the capability of filing their taxes through their platform. This is a huge leap in digital banking, and will inevitably lead to new competition in different spheres. 

* Cash app is using technologies such as Google Cloud’s AI Platform paired with NVIDIA processing technology to help with the furthering of innovation on its platform. These services also play a crucial role with processing vast amounts of information each second. They use PCI Data Standard (PCI-DSS) level 1 compliant encryption to ensure the safety of their customers as well!

## **Landscape:**
---
* Digital Banking is the domain in which Cash App resides, and though they have been around since 2013, since the pandemic Cash App their platform has exploded in size by nearly quadruple the users they had in 2018. 

* Online capability/access, mobile banking has seen an increase in adoption rate over debit cards even with a steady growth in circulation, along with the block chain to name a few.

*Venmo is the primary competitor of Cash App, along with Zelle, however Venmo’s parent company PayPal is also the largest competitor in the digital banking scene as a whole. 

## **Results**
---
* Digital banking has been impacted by Cash App being one of the first to implement direct deposits, debit cards, and the exchanging of cryptocurrency on a digital platform. Similarly they also were one of the first to bring fractional trading to the digital landscape as a whole. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
A few major metrics that companies like Cash App use to measure success are functionality, activity, along with launch and load times. Cash App has an average of 44 million monthly active users. On top of that, the functionality the app provides is on par, if not increasingly becoming more advanced than its competitors with the innovations they’ve been making. With that being said, it only takes mere seconds to load, and less than a minute to complete a transaction. 

* Cash app is performing on par with its competitors, and with moving to europe in 2022 are anticipated to have a much farther reach than some of its competitors such as venmo. They have also seen rapid growth in its platform increasing nearly 80% each year over the course of the last 4 years! 

## **Recommendations**
---
* Something that would elevate cash apps reach along with functionality, is if they were to implement robo advisor to further increase their investing platform. I think it would become a pivotal play in setting a new standard that its competitors are already behind them in. 

*If they were to create this functionality within the application, it would expand their investing platform significantly which may also help bring in older demographics. This demographic may not be their target audience, however these older demographics hold more than 50% of the total wealth in America which is Cash Apps primary region. 

* Through the use of artificial technology, Cash App could develop an algorithm  that utilizes the Modern Portfolio Theory to base its general suggestions on which companies to invest in with a few risk tolerance options to better assist the everyday users trading experience. 

* With a better investment platform, and technology to match the expectations of normal consumers, Cash App will be able to be more marketable to those who may not have the proper resources of how to properly manage a portfolio or know what they need to focus on depending on their stage in life. Though for those with the resources, they will be able to utilize these platforms more effectively for small form trading or even to avoid extensive fees from maintaining a financial advisor.
